    <h1> Grid </h1>

    <p>
    Grid is a personal project that I've wanted to build for
    a long time, and now feel qualified to build. The core
    mission for the product is to connect people who want to
    make a difference in the world with organizations that
    are out in the world making a difference! I have partnered
    with 12 students in a upper-level marketing class at
    Washington University in St. Louis to help me hone my
    vision for the product through unit testing -- they're
    currently helping me hone my go-to-market strategy for
    the product.

    <p>
    NOTE: this product is actively under development! I post
    updates on the web page for it, you can follow along by
    periodically checking in on the web page for this project
    (just beyong the link below) or by checking out the
    content on my second youtube channel, where I am
    capturing the experience of bringing the app to life!"
