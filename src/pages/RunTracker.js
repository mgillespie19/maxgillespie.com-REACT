    <h1> Run Tracker </h1>

    <h2> inspiration </h2>
    <p>
      Run Tracker is a project for a class where students break into
      teams and are expected to publish an application on the app store.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was in a group with 2 other students who are on the track team at WashU,
      and they noted a problem with the current website they were using to log
      their runs. We thought we could build something better than that site.
    </p>

    <h2> what is it? </h2>
    <p>
      An app that allows running teams and invidiuals to easily track and log
      runs while building a community with other users: either both teammates
      and independent runners!
    </p>

    <h2> brainstorming </h2>
    <h3> concept development </h3>
    <p>
      THIS IS THE PHASE WE ARE CURRENTLY IN! check back for updates on the
      project, or send me an email to stay up to date on our progress. We plan
      on publishing our first version of the app by mid-March.
