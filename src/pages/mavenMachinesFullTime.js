        <h1> Maven Machines </h1>

        <p>
            Maven is a Series A ($8.3M total) B2B SaaS startup in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania that
            makes asset tracking software for the transportation industry.
            I worked with Maven during the summer of 2019 as an Android
            Devloper, and now work full-time at the company as a product 
            designer and software engineer.
