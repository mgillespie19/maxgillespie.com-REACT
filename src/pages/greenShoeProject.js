    <h1> Green Shoe Project </h1>
    <p>
      For as long as I can remember, Iâ€™ve been enamored with the power of
      sneakers to communicate to  consumers through their design and bring
      people together who would otherwise have nothing in common.
    </p>
    <p>
      The world of footwear still has a long way to go before the biggest
      players are doing as much as they can to help reduce their carbon
      footprint and improve their stustainability, and I want to be a part of
      the dialogue that fixes that.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project is my first steps into being a part of that dialogue
    </p>

      super cool WashU student-run fashion magazine.
