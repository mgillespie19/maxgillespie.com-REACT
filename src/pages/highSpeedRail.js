    <h1> The Future of Transportation </h1>

    <h2> inspiration </h2>
    <p>
      The following work is my final project for a class I took called Technical
      Writing during the fall semester of my senior year was Washington
      University in St. Louis.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were tasked with creating anything: with taking a concept that had been
      nagging us in the back of our minds, and transforming that into something
      physical that we could hold.
    </p>

    <h2> what is it? </h2>
    <p>
      I decided to make a mock magazine article for a magazine called
      Popular Mechanics -- I wrote about the future of high speed rail, and
      green transportation at large, in America and the roadblocks we will face
      along the way in the realization of these technologies.
